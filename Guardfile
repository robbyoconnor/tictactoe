# A sample Guardfile
# More info at https://github.com/guard/guard#readme

## Uncomment and set this to only include directories you want to watch
# directories %w(app lib config test spec feature)

## Uncomment to clear the screen before every task
clearing :on

## Guard internally checks for changes in the Guardfile and exits.
## If you want Guard to automatically start up again, run guard in a
## shell loop, e.g.:
##
##  $ while bundle exec guard; do echo "Restarting Guard..."; done
##


guard :rspec, cmd: "bundle exec rspec" do
  require "guard/rspec/dsl"
  dsl = Guard::RSpec::Dsl.new(self)

  # Feel free to open issues for suggestions and improvements

  # RSpec files
  rspec = dsl.rspec
  watch(rspec.spec_helper) { rspec.spec_dir }
  watch(rspec.spec_support) { rspec.spec_dir }
  watch(rspec.spec_files)

  # Ruby files
  ruby = dsl.ruby
  dsl.watch_spec_files_for(ruby.lib_files)

end
