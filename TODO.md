# Things I want to do
- [ ] Write tests -- taking advantage of the modularity **IN PROGRESS**
- [ ] Decouple the UI from the backend and write a web-frontend
- [ ] Continue to clean up the code where ever possible.
- [ ] Make the computer a bit smarter -- it's not smart enough for me.
     

# Completed 
- [x] You should be able to play against the computer.
- [x] Explain your algorithm for win detection (don't just hard code winning patterns).
- [x] You should be able to pick who is the computer player and who is the human player.
- [x] The application should run in the terminal only (no web interface)
- [x] The computer does not need to be smart.  Randomly selecting an available space is fine.
- [x] When the game is done, it should announce who the winner is and ask if you want to play again.
- [x] The application should be built using object oriented design.
- [x] Make the grid size variable
- [x] Keep your code DRY
- [x] Make the computer player smart
- [x] Randomize who gets the first turn between computer and human players
